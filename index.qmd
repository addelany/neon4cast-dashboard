Welcome the [EFI](https://ecoforecast.org) NEON Forecast Challenge Dashboard.

This site provides daily updates to visualize recent scores of all forecasts submitted to the challenge. This site is generated using [quarto](https://quarto.org) and should be simple to customize for users familiar with RMarkdown. It is rendered daily using GitHub Actions.

EFI currently has five open challenge themes! Browse the current forecasts or submit your own. Learn more about the [current challenges](https://projects.ecoforecast.org/neon4cast-docs).
